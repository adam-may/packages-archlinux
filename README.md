AUR Packages
------------

Now that AUR 4.x is available, this repository is just for tracking issues 
and pull requests to AUR packages that I maintain or co-maintain.

All packages that I maintain that are available on AUR are located in
[`aur`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/aur) as copies
for purposes of submitting pull requests,
and in [`aur4`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/aur4)
as submodules for ease of tracking.

Unmaintained, old packages (e.g. that were disowned, orphaned, etc.) might
still linger in the [`old`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/old) directory,
in case anyone wants to pick them up.

Contributing
------------

If you want to adopt or co-maintain a package, submit an AUR comment, GitHub issue,
or email me.  I'll be grateful for the help!  Now that AUR4 supports comaintainers,
I can add you as a co-maintainer, or if you prefer I can also disown the package 
for you to adopt it.  (Submitting an orphan request on AUR also works for the latter.)

Please feel free to submit a GitHub issue or pull request here if you do not
want the burden of maintainership.
